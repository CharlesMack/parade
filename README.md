### **üéä SnapFrame Parade: The Festive Celebration Camera**

\!

**SnapFrame Parade** is a vibrant, web-based camera application that turns capturing moments into an interactive, joyous celebration. Built for the modern creator who wants more than just a photo, it transforms your screen into a live "parade" of your own memories, complete with confetti, dynamic animations, and intuitive controls. This is the ultimate "quick-draw" camera for fun, entertainment, and stress-free creative expression.

### **üöÄ Core Features: Your Celebration Toolkit**

  * **Dual-Function Shutter:** A simple tap captures a photo, while a press-and-hold records a video. This gives you instant control without switching modes.
  * **Persist Rec:** Toggle this feature to turn the video recorder into a single-tap start/stop function, perfect for "hands free recording" and capturing longer moments without holding the button down.
  * **üéâ The Parade Effect:** After every capture, your photos and videos "shoot off like a rocket" and fly around the screen. Videos play silently on a loop until you tap them to unmute. This creates a lively, real-time screensaver of your memories.
  * **Interactive Physics:** Drag, drop, and flick floating media to send it flying in new directions. Collision detection makes media "bounce" off each other, adding to the playful, festive feel.
  * **Screensaver Mode:** Enable this to make your media parade last indefinitely, transforming your device into a continuous, floating gallery of joy and excitement.
